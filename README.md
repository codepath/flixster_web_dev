### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Add your response here

The topics discussed in the labs did help me co mplete the assignments as I did refer to the labs a lot while making this assignment. I did feel a bit unprepared to handle the styling of website, especially when it came to making the cards for each movie.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

Add your response here

I would have made the cards a bit smaller and add more space between them, center the search bar, create a tab for the close button, add a load more button for the search section, add more stretch features like adding a popup window for the movie details and trailer.
  

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Add your response here

I liked the slides I designed and I think I did a good job of explaining my features. I think next time I'll go in more depth anbout the features and give more details.
