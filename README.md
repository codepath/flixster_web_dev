### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
  The topics in my labs prepared me to complete the assignment, especially lab 3 where we also integrated API. I felt unprepared add some stretch features through CSS & animation.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  If I had more time I wouldv'e liked to fiddle with different CSS & animations to portray my website in the best way possible.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
  I think creating a basic layout went really well, it was fascinating seeing how such a basic thing could improve so much. I think next time i'd like to toggle with the dark-mode feature. It's interesting how that could make such a big difference in terms of accessibility.
