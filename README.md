### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt unprepared to implement the 'load more' and search functions, I felt that after reviewing lecture notes, Lab 3 solutions and the internet I was still struggling to grasp how to solve these issues.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have collaborated more with other interns. With this project, I wanted to work more alone in hopes of finishing completely on my own but I may not be on that level yet.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think displaying the movies on the site went well, but I didn't get to finish the project in time like I planned to. 

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I enjoyed hammering out little details with Bereket on the labs and the beginning of the project. Instructor Ashaun helped me a lot with getting the API to work!
