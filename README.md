üìù **NOTE** Use this template to initialize the contents of a README.md file for your application. As you work on your assignment over the course of the week, update the required or stretch features lists to indicate which features you have completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.

## Week 1 Assignment: Flixster

Submitted by: Iden

Estimated time spent: 25 hours

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics we discussed in the labs prepared me for the assignment in terms of understanding the concepts in general. In terms of actually implementing the code to make the program, I did not feel as prepared because although I understood the theory I found it difficult to start. In class for the lesson on APIs I understood the concepts but I found it difficult to do it on my own. The lesson on Git was very helpful for me because I had no prior experience with Git. 


- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would have loved to add a feature that pops up movies as the user is typing the name of the movie they are looking for. This would require me to query an API but I need more time to work on these skills in order to fully grasp the code I would need to implement this change. I also would like to add a navigation bar. The navigation bar would direct people to a trending page, a page for further information where people can search the movies they are interested in, and a genre section where they can find movies of the same genre and similar movies to what they were initially interested in.
  

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think the peer programming went very well for me. I enjoy learning from people who are in the same position as I am. Even though we are all learning the same concepts, some people have had prior experience and although they may not be experts the experience that they posess allows them to explain things in a simplified way. A lot of my peers had amazing features that I hope I can implement in the next few weeks. Some have a dark/light mode option, interactive images, and the search pop up feature I wanted to add to my own website.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I'd like to give a shoutout to Pelumi for answering my questions and helping me throughout the duration of the project.
I'd like to give a shoutout to David for helping me with my API, I was having some trouble and he made a huge difference.
I'd like to give a shout out to Kelechi for always answering my random javascript questions in class whenever I don't fully grasp a concept.
